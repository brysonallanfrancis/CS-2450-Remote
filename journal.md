	Large things are emphasized -- Color has meaning, use it intentionally -- # of elements is important, 7 (+/- 2) objects per page. -- Don't be too Informationally Dense. Be more effective. -- USE GOOD PICTURES

COLOR GUIDELINES: Red for ALERTS, Yellow for CHANGES/NEW ITEMS, Green for GOOD/FAMILIAR THINGS, Gray for OUT OF SCOPE/NON-IMPORTANT, Blue for NEUTRAL/EXISTING THINGS, Orange for THINGS THAT ARE CHANGING

ELEMENT SIZE/LOCATION: Organize Left to Right for good flow -- Be consistent within your presentation conventions

	The Software Development Process:
		- Create and issue
		- Add the issue to the kanban board (project)
		- Assign issue to people (self assigned or by scrum master)
		- Move from 'to-do' to 'in progress'
		- Create Branch
		- Move issue to 'done'
		- Make Pull request
		- Review code
		- Scrum Master merges the pull request

	Scrum Master:
		- Make sure the Kanban/Burn Down Chart is up to date
		- Make sure people are communicating
		- Conduct 5 min standup meeting
		- Refine github issues so there is no non-sense in there
		- Merge the pull requests
		- FACITILTATE -- NOT MANAGE
